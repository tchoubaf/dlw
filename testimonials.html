This past year things got a little rough for my family and I. But being a student leader on campus I have to be strong for those who may look up to me and for my peers. With all that I must also remember my main purpose which is my education and I did just that by completing the semester with a 3.5. I’ve learned to be strong for myself and learn the true value of patience. My goal is to not let myself and my peers down by shooting for that 4.0 no matter the circumstances. This contribution from this foundation means so much to me and I thank you all for working with me, working hard for me and helping me pay off this balance. You all are truly appreciated.
